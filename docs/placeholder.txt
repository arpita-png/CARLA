# client = carla.Client('localhost', 2000) --creates a communication channel between python script and the CARLA simulator.
localhost:<br>
-connect to a CARLA simulator that is running on this computer.<br>
-If the simulator is running on a remote machine, use its IP address (e.g., '192.168.1.42').<br>
2000: <br>
CARLA simulator running on port 2000, this is the TCP port number that CARLA uses by default.<br>
The simulator listens on this port for incoming Python API commands.<br>

# Phase1
Connect to the server<br>
Load a specific map<br>
Change the weather<br>
Spawn a vehicle<br>
Make it move with autopilot<br>

# Phase 2
Attach an RGB camera to the vehicle- connecting a virtual camera sensor to the vehicle inside the carla simulator
RGB- red, green, blue camera captures color images of what the vehicle sees from its perspective and use the captured data for visualization, object detection, lane keeping<br>
Capture images<br>
Display them live inside the Jupyter Notebook<br>
